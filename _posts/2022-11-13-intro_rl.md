# 1. (Saverio) Obiettivi: imparare il reinforcement learning con il forza 4 + spiegazione del gioco



What do you do if you want to teach your dog something like how to sit at command? you give it a treat when it do as wanted and you don't if it doesnt so hopefully the positive reward it gets will make it obey the command



It turns out that the same principle works on machines as well and it is called "reinforcement learning" because of the reinforcement that the machine receive after doing something that ends up into a positive reward.

unfortunately machines dont really like treats as well as dogs but they really like numbers so this is what we will use to model the problem
in particular we use three fundamental numerical signals: _state_, _action_, _reward_.

**spiegare un po' meglio stato e azione**
State signal encodes everything the action can't directly control, or what happens to the environment as consequence of the action if you will while hopefully what action and reward signals encode is already clear
**In sostanza la policy ci dice quale azione eseguire**
we also need a function that given a state will spit out the actions that maximize the expected reward, this function is called policy and it has to be optimized in the training process

** diagramma su azione stato policiy**
this approach has been tested in various cases where makes sense to have a model of the problem based on those three fundamental signals for example 
a tiny robot exploring a new environment in search of something: in this case the reward will tell the robot when it found the thing it was searching for,
or a program that can play some table games better than any human would do: in this case the reward will tell the program when it got a win or a lose

In this project we trained a policy to learn how to play the famous table game called "connect 4"
![](https://i.imgur.com/KkOFQ39.png)

the rules are simple, there is a 8x7 grid placed vertically and two players with coins of different colour (one colour for each player), every player can place a coin in one of the columns of the grid and it will fall down into the lowest empty cell of that column
when one of the player places a coin such that he creates a pattern of 4 aligned (in all directions including diagonals) coins of the same type then there is a win and the reward hits its maximum


# 2. (Paolo con esempio gelato) Spiegazione veloce del deep Q learning

Come funziona il Q-learning:
- approccio naif e perché non funziona
- esempio gelato parte 1
- introduzione dei vari concetti della formula di bellman usando il gelato
- esempio del gelato parte 2
- Spiegazione della formula di bellman
- Come utilizzare la formula di bellman per allenare un NN


So now our goal is to train a model for making it play to connect4. But for training a model -a 
neural network or more generally every model in machine learning- we need, above all, a **loss function**.

The loss function always plays a very important role, maybe the most important, as it defines
which function the model will approximate when it will be trained.
In most cases (for classification tasks for example) the loss function 
is simple and pretty intuitive (error in classification), but for reinforcement learning things are pretty trickier.

So the question is: which could be an adequate loss function for a model playing a game?


## The naif/classification approach

Let's start with a first (*wrong*) guess. An easy solution could be to proceed as for a classification task. So the model would take as input the state of the board, and as output the move to play. As there are 7 possible moves, the output should be something like this:

STATE (a tensor representing the board state) -> MODEL -> [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

In this case the model would choose the central column (with a value equal 1). 

And what about the loss?

Ideally the loss should be high for wrong moves and low for good moves. But how to define what a "good move" is? 

More generally, how can we validate a strategy or any choice in our life? Unfortunately there is only one sure way: wait until the end and look to the results. 
This is as true in reinforcement learning as in every other contest, but it is quite impractical.
If we wait until the end of the game, we are forced to accumulate gradients during all the moves, and calculate a unique total loss.

How could a model be able to learn anything with only a loss for the whole game? How to find the contribution of a move to the beginning of the game to the actual state? This is just impossible (or maybe theoretically possible for a very very long training but practically unfeasible). It will be almost the same as decide all possible strategies at the beginning of the game, before the opponent make any move! 

So we need to calculate our loss in a different way. The main problem in the "naif" method is that we could not compress a game in one loss. So we need a different approach, where we decompose the game move after move, in multiple losses. Rather than shallow the whole game, we have to give multiple bites, and capitalise knowledge at each step. 

But how to achieve this result? We are lucky, there is already a solution ready for us: the **Q-learning**.

## Q-learning


The main idea is to assign, for each possible state of the board, and for each possible move, a score.

We call $Q$ this score, as for the "quality" of the move.

This score tell us how likely this move can provide us a good reward on the long term. So in order to define $Q$, we need firstly to define the reward $R$ and the discount factor $\gamma$

Let's consider the following example. Bill is sitting idle in his armchair, when suddenly an idea flashes into his head: what about an ice cream?


![](https://i.imgur.com/YEIjxhR.png)

A decision has to be taken: what to do now? Does the reward associate to the ice-cream worth the uncomfort of leaving the armchair and walk to the freezer?

Let's make the math.

First, for applying Q-learning we need to _discretize_ the process, i.e. defining a minimal time step. We can take 10 seconds for our example.
Let's say steps in the process are:
    1. Get up from the armchair
    2. Walk to the freezer
    3. Take an ice cream
    4. Walk back to the armchair
    5. Sit down
    6. Eat the ice cream :)


Then we need to attribute a **reward** associated to each step. Negative rewards for less pleasant operation and a positive reward for eating the ice cream, as in the figure below

![](https://i.imgur.com/rAzB4bo.png)

So, how to state if the pleasure of eating an ice cream worth all the sacrifices associated, like quitting this so comfortable armchair ?

A _naive_ approach could be taking the sum of all the rewards, so for example:

\begin{eqnarray*}
r_{tot} & = & r_{1}+...+r_{6}\\
 & = & -10+(-5)+(-5)+(-5)+(-7)+100\\
 & = & 68
\end{eqnarray*}

The total reward would be $68$, which is a positive number, so the ice cream definitely worth the effort of taking it.

But, if you think about it carefully, there is a problem.

For getting the ice cream, you need to quit the armachair _immediately_. And you will get the ice cream after. It is clear that a reward in a distant future has less value then a reward now. And at the same time an effort in the future seem less unpleasent (this is why we agree to planify gym for the next week, but we change idea faced to the effort).

How taking in account this factor ?

Adding a parameter called **discount factor**, which exprimes the importance of future rewards compared to an immediate action.





# 3.  - Tradeoff exploration - exploitation: vogliamo la miglior soluzione ma vogliamo esplorare diverse soluzioni
  
 
in the reinforcement learning field a key concept is represented by the tradeoff 
   between exploration and exploitation. Training a policy to be able to output always 
   the best action in a given state would need it to be always "greedy" for the action value, 
   but a greedy model would never explore and this means that a lot of potentially valuable actions 
   are just ignored. 
   
 ##  3.1 $\varepsilon$-greedy
   
In Reinforcement Learning, the agent or decision-maker, which interacts with the environment, is capable to learn what to do, this is, how to map situations to actions, in order to maximize a reward. 
The agent is not explicitly aware of which action to take, but instead must discover which action can lead the most reward through trial and error.
By going through the simulation it is possible to understand how the algorithm (agent) explores the action space and exploits the knowledge at any given time step. This tradeoff is fundamental to many RL algorithms. 
Exploration allows an agent to enhance its current knowledge about each action, hopefully leading to long-term benefit. Improving the accuracy of the estimated action-values, enables an agent to make more informed decisions in the future.
Exploitation, on the other hand, adopts the greedy action to get the most reward by exploiting the agent’s current action-value estimates. But by being greedy with respect to action-value estimates, may not actually get the most reward and lead to sub-optimal behaviour.
Epsilon-Greedy is a simple method to balance exploration and exploitation by choosing between exploration and exploitation randomly.
Exploitation generally means taking advantage of the currently available results, while exploration emphasizes the search for new solutions. Striking a delicate balance between the two can lead to better results.
   
   
   
  ### 3.2 separazione tra modello per il target e per la policy (spiegare pure cosa sono) *off-policy* et *on-policy*
  ### 3.2.1) Aggiornamento del target model: per aggiornare il target model si puo usare uno step fisso, oppure uno score (*mirror score*)
   
 A policy could be trained to be both explorative and eploitative at the same time but by definition this means that some times this kind of policy will not choose the best action in order to explore the others. A solution for this problem is provided by "off-policy" 
   algorithms, a class of algorithms (such as q-learning) that use different policies for different scopes, in particular some policies are more explorative and some others are exploitative.
After the training we want to have a policy that after some exploration has found a good strategy to exploit for maximizing the total reward, this is called the "target" policy. In this example the target policy is found evaluating and training epsilon-greedy policies which will explore less as time passes and hence they will become more greedy, during the training the policy's parameters will be copied to the target policy and this is how the target policy is computed. 
An additional step is added before the copy and it is the evaluation step, the policy's performance is evaluated using the "mirror score" and compared to the one of the current target policy, the copy will take place overwriting the old parameters only if the score is higher which means that the new target is better than the current one. This step ensure the new target to be strictly better after every replacement
   


# 4. (Bruno) Come il Q-learning si declina nel nostro caso


## 4.1 Spiegazione generale:(no dettagli)




## (Saverio) 4.2 Classe BatchBoard 

- Varie partite sono giocate in parallelo
- L'insieme degli stati per le varie partite è memorizzato su un tensore
- Ad ogni step una mossa viene selezionata per ogni board nel batch e giocata
- Per ogni giocata, la ricompense (e la loss) viene calcolata per ogni board nel batch
- Quando le partite finiscono per una board nel batch, questa si reinizializza senza modificare le altre
- Aggiungere estratti di codice




## 4.3 (Nick) Architettura conv contro linear layer

## 4.4 (Pietro) Il greedy player per allenare (citazione a progetto simile Fabio)

### 4.4.1 Perché un algoritmo greedy (che è diverso da $\varepsilon$-greedy!)?
Se il modello viene fatto giocare completamente a caso, non impara molto bene e si "disperde".
Bisogna quindi diminuire il lato esplorativo, inserendo nel training delle mosse che abbiano un minimo senso.
Quindi se nel $\varepsilon$-greedy abbiamo una percentuale di mosse giocate a caso, ora avremo una percentuale di mosse giocate con un algoritmo greedy.
- Una parte di mosse decise dal target - all'inizio del gioco fa schifo
- Una parte di mosse fatte a caso - fa sempre schifo
- Aggiunto alla fine -> Una parte di mosse greedy - all'inizio del gioco è molto forte
   
Le percentuali relative possono variare col tempo

### 4.4.2 Come funziona l'algoritmo greedy?
A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving a problem by selecting the best option available at the moment. It doesn't worry whether the current best result will bring the overall optimal result. It can be considered as a particular case of the RL algorithm with a $\gamma = 0$.

Che cos'è il vantaggio immediato a forza 4?
Lo calcoliamo prendendo quante "terzine aperte" (ossia 3 gettoni dello stesso colore seguiti da un buco, di fila e che potenzialmente possono essere completate) ha il giocatore e l'avversario.
L'algoritmo greedy gioca la mossa che massimizza il numero nelle proprie terzine (e ancora più delle quartine, ossia vince se può farlo) e diminuisce il numero delle terzine avversarie (blocca l'avversario se può farlo)

L'idea viene dall'Articolo Fabio ->   [https://medium.com/@florijan.stamenkovic_99541/learning-a-five-in-a-row-policy-using-pytorch-5a11f38ee474](https://medium.com/@florijan.stamenkovic_99541/learning-a-five-in-a-row-policy-using-pytorch-5a11f38ee474)



## (Pietro) 4.5 Il mirror score

*player* is the player which we want to measure the ability of.


n_batch, n_iter: quante partite vogliamo giocare per il test (più partite giochiamo più è preciso)
rand_ratio: proporzione partite giocate dal secondo
second-player giocatore utilizzato come riferimento per misurare la forza

rand_ratio = 0.2 -> 20% delle mosse le gioca second-player (unicamente per il secondo giocatore)

1st  move: player VS second-player
2nd  move: player VS player
3rd  move: player VS player
4th  move: player VS player
5th  move: player VS second-player
6th  move: player VS player
7th  move: player VS player
8th  move: player VS player
9th  move: player VS player
10th move: player VS player
11th move: player VS player
12th move: player VS second-player
13th move: player VS player
14th move: player VS player


* if *player* and *second-player* have the same ability level, they win the same number of games, then score = (ratio_won - ratio_lost) = 0 
* if *player* is a bit more skillful than *second-player*, then ratio_won > ratio_lost;
* if *player* is much more skillful than *second-player*, then ratio_won >> ratio_lost  $\simeq$ 1;


Analogia con gli scacchi: prendi due bambini (player) e rimpiazzi qualcuna delle loro mosse con delle mosse a caso: cambia poco.
Prendo due gran maestri (player) e rimpiazzo alcune delle mosse di uno di loro con mosse a caso: quasi sicuramente il giocatore al quale rimiazzo le mosse perderà. 
Questo perché il livello della partita è più alto e ogni sbaglio ha più peso

Due modi di vederlo:
- Più il livello è alto, più gli sbagli pesano
- Più due livelli sono diversi, più una mescolanza dei due avrà forza diversa rispetto al giocatore originale (es: mescolo birra con acqua, oppure grappa con acqua)

**Possiamo misurare la forza di un giocatore in modo autoreferenziale e trovare un indicatore che permette di confrontare la forza di due giocatori, senza bisogno che si affrontino**

Il modello Pytorch creato in precedenza e' memorizzato nel file 'model_793620001.pth'.
Lo si vuole convertire in un formato Light Tensorflow ___per quale motivo?___.

Quindi si carica il modello con il metodo load_model (presente nel file 'model/model_helper.py')
e verra' utilizzata la classe TFLiteConverter per convertire il modello Pyorch nel modello Tensorflo light.
