### Who are we?

We are a group of enthusiast in deep learning, who meet (virtually, on Discord) on thursday evening, to work on projects about neural networks.

We try to reproduce (sometimes to innovate) classical algorithms or models "from scratch", to better understand how they work. All our projects are realized in Pytorch

For any request, you can contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/VXEH5weceY)
